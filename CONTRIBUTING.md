# Contributing to `pg-sse`

`pg-sse` is hosted at [Github](http://github.com/suhlig/`pg-sse`). We highly welcome bug reports, documentation as well as code updates and any other contributions.

Please follow these guidelines if you want to start working on `pg-sse`:

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Make sure to add tests for your changes and change existing tests if needed. This is important so we don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Open a pull request, and we'll work from that to integrate it.

`pg-sse` attempts to follow the [Pull Request Hack](http://felixge.de/2013/03/11/the-pull-request-hack.html).
